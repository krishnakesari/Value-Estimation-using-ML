# Value Estimation using ML

In this repository I will show, how we can build a value estimation system using Supervised Learning

Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Steps Involved:
1. Feature Selection 
2. Train Data
3. Finding right weights
4. Find Equation to model the prediction
5. Build Cost function to quantify the error in the model
6. Use Optimization algorithm (like gradient descent) to find model parameters that minimize cost function
